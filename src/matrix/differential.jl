# Assumption: we don't calculate derivatives for interpolated fields.  In other words, we
# calculate derivatives for the original fields defined on Yee's grid.  (There are
# exceptions; see below.)  This assumption simplifies implementation of the symmetry
# boundary condition in the derivative operators greatly.
#
# For example, suppose we use the primal grid planes as the E-field planes.  Then, for the
# symmetry boundary condition (which is the PEC boundary condition in this case), the fields
# defined on the domain boundaries are the tangential  E-fields and normal H-fields.  Both
# fields are zero on the symmetry boundaries.  Therefore, if we assume that we calculate
# derivatives only for those fields defined on Yee's grid, we do not have to construct
# separate derivative operators for the tangential E-field and normal H-field.  (Note that
# the derivative operator for the tangential E-field is used in curl for E, and the
# derivative operator for the normal H-field is used in divergence for H.)
#
# If we allow application of derivative operators to interpolated fields, there are cases
# where the boundary condition for those fields cannot be implemented in the derivative
# operators simply by zeroing the interpolated fileds.  For instance, in the aformentioned
# system, suppose we interpolate the normal E-field on the boundary.  Then, because the
# normal E-fields remain the same around the boundary, the interpolation on the boundary
# surface does not lead to zero.  Therefore, in the derivative operator for the normal
# E-field, we cannot implement the symmetry boundary condition simply by zeroing the fields.
# Supporting such interpolated fields would make the code for the derivative operators very
# convoluted, so we will assume that we don't deal with such cases.
#
# There are exceptions for this assumption.  As long as the interpolated fields on the
# symmetry boundaries are zero, our derivative operator code can be used to differentiate
# such interpolated fields.  For example, again in the aformentioned system, even though the
# normal D-field is not zero on the symmetry boundary, a portion of it could be zero in the
# following situation.  Suppose we are dealing with anisotropic materials.  Then, if we are
# dealing with the z-normal boundaries, Dz is the normal D-field but it is expressed as
# Dz = εzx Ex + εzy Ey + εzz Ez = Dzx + Dzy + Dzz.  Here, even though Dzz is nonzero because
# Ez is nonzero, Dzx and Dzy are zero because Ex and Ey are tangential to the PEC boundary.
# Therefore, we can use our derivative operator to differentiate Dzx and Dzy along the
# z-direction.  (I don't think there will be cases where we would need to differentiate Dzx
# and Dzy, but I mention this for consistency with the averaging operators in mean.jl,
# because we do need to take averages for Dzx and Dzy.)

# I need to figure out whether the ±1 entries of the backward difference operator is always
# the transpose of the forward difference operator for all boundary conditions. (∆w division
# factors are different, though.)  This was the case in the MATLAB code, but in the Julia
# code I changed the treatment of PDC, so let's make sure about this again.
#
# For the symmetry boundary for the E-field (then the E-fields are on the primal grid planes),
# assuming E that is correctly zeroed at the negative boundary is supplied to the forward
# difference operator, we can take the ±1 pattern of the forward difference operator for the
# Bloch boundary as the ±1 pattern of the forward difference operator for the symmetry
# boundary, because E = 0 is correctly used for the value at the positive boundary because
# the field value is copied from the negative boundary.
#
# Now, let's think about the backward difference operator for H.  Because the boundary is
# the symmetry boundary for E, the ghost H₀, which is before the negative boundary, must be
# the same as the non-ghost H₁.  Therefore, this leads to the first difference being H₁-H₀ =
# H₁-H₁ = 0, which means that the first row of the backward difference operator must be
# empty.  However, when the forward difference operator for the symmetry boundary is created
# the same as that for Bloch, its transpose does not have an empty first row!
#
# For the backward differce operater to be the transpose of the forward difference operator,
# I need to create the forward difference operator such that E₁ is zeroed.  This turns out
# to work.  See my notes on Sep/06/2017 in RN - MaxwellFDM.jl.

    # boundary condition, the modification needs to be made only at the array entries with
    # the first or last subscript of the Cartesion direction in which the differentiation is
    # taken.
    #
    # The outline of the procedure is as follows:
    #
    # 1. Detertmine the rows in which the modification should be made.  This is done by
    # figuring out the array subscripts (i,j,k) of the output derivative array entries to
    # which the input boundary fields contribute.
    #
    # 2. In each of these rows, determine the column in which the modification should be
    # made.  Because each row has only two nonzero entries (one diagoal and one off-diagonal),
    # this step is to determine whether the modification should be made at the diagonal
    # entry or the off-diagonal entry in the row currently concerned.  If the array
    # subscripts of the input fields contributing to the currently concerned output
    # derivatives are the same as the array subscripts of the output derivatives, the
    # modification is made in V₀ (diagonal).  If they are different, the modification is
    # made in Vₛ (off-diagonal).
    #
    # 3. In the determined rows, modify either V₀ or Vₛ depending on the above step.  This
    # is to modify V₀[i,j,k] or Vₛ[i,j,k], where (i,j,k) is the array subscripts specifying
    # the determined row.
