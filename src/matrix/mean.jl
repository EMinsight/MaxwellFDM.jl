# Assumption: we don't calculate averages for interpolated fields.  In other words, we
# calculate averages for the original fields defined on Yee's grid.  (There are exceptions;
# see below.)  This assumption simplifies implementation of the symmetry boundary condition
# in the averaging operators greatly.
#
# For example, suppose we use the primal grid planes as the E-field planes.  Then, for the
# symmetry boundary condition (which is the PEC boundary condition in this case), the fields
# defined on the domain boundaries are the tangential  E-fields and normal H-fields.  Both
# fields are zero on the symmetry boundaries.  Therefore, if we assume that we calculate
# averages only for those fields defined on Yee's grid, we do not have to construct
# separate averaging operators for the tangential E-field and normal H-field.
#
# See the comments in differential.jl as well.

# The averaging scheme in SALT will be mostly used with the Bloch boundary condition, so the
# implementation of the impact of boundary conditions in the averaging scheme is actually
# not that important, because field averaging at the boundaries is trivial for the Bloch
# boundary condition.

# The forward and (-1) × backward averaging operators are not the transpose of each other
# when the symmetry boundary condition is used: one has element with the factor of 2
# multiplied while the other with the factor of zero.  Still, the symmetry boundary enforces
# a special structure on the subpixel smoothed material parameter tensor on the symmetry
# boundary.  This tensor of a special structure has zero entries where the non-transpose
# relationship between the forward and backward averaging matters, and eventually makes the
# effect of this non-transpose relationship does not propagate up to the symmetry of the
# final operator (i.e., the final operator is still symmetric even though the forward and
# (-1) × backward averaging operators are not the transpose of each other). See my notes
# entitled [Beginning of the part added on Aug/14/2018] in RN - Subpixel Smoothing.nb.

# The role of the `kdiag` argument
# This argument is used to interpolate Cartesian components of a vector field at locations
# where the components are not defined, e.g., to interpolate Ex at Ez-locations.  For that,
# the first interpolation needs to be applied to these Cartesian components at the grid cell
# corners (kdiag = 0).  This will leave Ex at Ex-indices in the output column vector.  (It
# is easier to consider the averaging operators in the block-matrix form (i.e., reorder=false).)
# Then, the second interpolation needs to be applied to the corner Ex at the Ez-locations.
# This requires not only averaging these corner Ex along the z-direction, but also putting
# the Ex-components at the Ez-indices.  Similarly, this second interpolation needs to put
# Ey-components at the Ex-indices, and Ez-components at the Ey-indices.  So, the second
# interpolation matrix should look like
# ⎡   Mx   ⎤
# ⎢      My⎥
# ⎣Mz      ⎦
# where Mw is the operator averaging along the w-direction.  So, the second interpolation
# matrix is generated with kdiag = +1.  Similarly, the matrix generated with kdiag = -1 is
# ⎡      Mx⎤
# ⎢My      ⎥
# ⎣   Mz   ⎦
# and this puts the Ex-components at the Ey-indices, Ey-components at the Ez-indices, and
# Ez-components at the Ex-indices.
#
# Note that both kdiag = ±1 shift the diagonal blocks along the row directions.  This is
# different from diagm(kdiag => v) or MATLAB's diag(v, kdiag).

    # factors for the Bloch boundary condition or by multiplying 0 or 2 to some diagonal and

    # is due to the boundary condition, the modification needs to be made only at the array
    # entries with the first or last subscript of the Cartesion direction in which averaging
    # is taken.
    #
    # The outline of the procedure is as follows:
    #
    # 1. Detertmine the rows in which the modification should be made.  This is done by
    # figuring out the array subscripts (i,j,k) of the output average array entry to which
    # the input boundary fields contribute.
    #
    # 2. In each of these rows, determine the column in which the modification should be
    # made.  Because each row has only two nonzero entries (one diagoal and one off-diagonal),
    # this step is to determine whether the modification should be made at the diagonal
    # entry or the off-diagonal entry in the row currently concerned.  If the (i,j,k) of the
    # input fields contributing to the currently concerned output averages are the same as
    # the (i,j,k) of the output averages, the modification is made in V₀ (diagonal).  If
    # they are different, the modification is made in Vₛ (off-diagonal).
    #
    # 3. In the determined rows, modify either V₀ or Vₛ depending on the above step.  This
    # is to modify V₀[i,j,k] or Vₛ[i,j,k], where (i,j,k) is the array subscripts specifying
    # the determined row.

        # the symmetry boundaries.

        # On the other hand, on the negative-end boundary the average of the dual field is

        # the symmetry boundary by doubling the effect of the input field at the first
        # dual grid point and zeroing the effect of the input field at the ghost point.
        #
        # The input field at the first dual grid point is subscripted the same as the output
        # average, so its effect is described in a diagonal entry in V₀.  The input field at
        # the ghost point is subscripted 1 less in the w-direction, so its effect is
